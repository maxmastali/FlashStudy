For my CS50x final project, I created a web application called FlashStudy. FlashStudy allows users to create and study from flashcards. Once users create a flashcard set, they go back to the index page, which shows a list of all of their current flashcard sets. Users can then click on one of their flashcard sets, and FlashStudy will show all the individual flashcards corresponding to that set. Users also have the option of toggling the visibility for either the terms or definitions, which will help them study. Users are able to delete their sets (from the same page that they study the set from). Users also have the ability to add flashcards to each of their sets. Lastly, the system of handling users is similar to CS50x's Finance assignment, in that users can login, register, and change their password.
